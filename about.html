        Conversation Filer for Outlook 2016
    </div>
    <div class="ms-font-m">
        <p>
            Conversation Filer can find other messages in the same conversation and file all of the messages in the same folder. This is particularly handy when a mailing list
            filing rule is broken by the Bcc feature in an attempt to take the discussion off-list. Conversation Filer can show you where the rest of the messages in the
            conversation were previously filed and move the new messages there with another click.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Conversation Filer has full read and write access to your mailbox, it does not collect any of your data or make any changes to your data other than
            moving items to the folder you pick. For more details, please refer to the <a target="_blank" href="./privacy.html">privacy policy</a>.
