        <p>
            Conversation Filer can find other messages in the same conversation and file all of the messages in the same folder. This is particularly handy when a mailing list
            filing rule is broken by the Bcc feature in an attempt to take the discussion off-list. Conversation Filer can show you where the rest of the messages in the
            conversation were previously filed and move the new messages there with another click.
