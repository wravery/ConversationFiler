        <p>
            Although Conversation Filer has full read and write access to your mailbox, it does not collect any of your data or make any changes to your data other than
            moving items to the folder you pick. The only requests that it makes are to your mailbox, and to download static files from this site. It does not send your
            data anywhere else. At most, I would be able to tell that you have used the App by looking at my server logs, but I could not tell how you used it or what
            the contents of any of your emails were.
        </p>

            If you are inclined to double check, or if you just want to see how it works, feel free to browse the source code on <a href="https://github.com/wravery/ConversationFiler">GitHub</a>.
            The contents of this site are deployed directly from there when I commit a change.
